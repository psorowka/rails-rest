A Gem for creating more RESTful resources in rails

What's really RESTful?
----------------------

Unfortunately, there is no RFC document or other standardization for RESTful Interfaces. Yet, there are some common agreements on the methods and URL-schemes a RESTful Interface should provide. I am far from postulating the holy grail of REST, but I really like the following scheme, which is in broad use:

| URI                                          |  Method | Description                           |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| http://example.com/resources                 |  GET    |                                       |
|                                              |  POST   |                                       |
|                                              |  PUT    |                                       |
